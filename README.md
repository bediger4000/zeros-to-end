# Move all zeros in an array to its end

Write a method that moves all zeros in an array to its end. You should
maintain the order of all other elements. Here's an example:

    zerostoend([1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0])
    // [1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Here's another one:

    zerosToEnd([1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0])
    // [1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Can you do this without instantiating a new array?

## Analysis

Ha ha, both examples are the same!
